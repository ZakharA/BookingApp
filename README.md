How to run:
easy to just run it in Visual Studio
or
 - dotnet build // in BookingApp folder
 - cd into Api
 - dotnet run
 - open in browser http://localhost:5235/swagger/index.html
   if not working please check the port that the running app is listening on

limitations:
- I was not sure whether the booking time can be or should accept times that are not exact, ie 10:30 to 10:29.
